Create a main folder called genie.
Inside the genie folder, add the frontend files I uploaded into a folder named frontend.
On the backend side, create a database.
An API file called mealAPI.js is already created inside the services folder. This is where the frontend connects to the database. Make sure any API setup or changes are done there.
Note: The code will not run if the backend is not up and running.
Youâ€™ll need to use a free meal database or connect to one. Creating a new meal database from scratch is unnecessary and will waste time.
